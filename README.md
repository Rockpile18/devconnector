# will_builder

Form Building Web App 

Intended to work as a proof of concept for Pro Bono Legal Document services that build fully executable documents that simply need to be printed and signed.
- First Build will allow the creation of a user, adding profile data to that user then ultimately create a Will Document with that data.


To install and run the webapp locally after cloning: (using node.js)
- npm install
- npm run dev
